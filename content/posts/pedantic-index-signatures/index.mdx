TypeScript 4.1 beta was [announced recently](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/),
and it introduces many new and exciting features.
While I won't pretend to understand (yet) what you will be able to do with
[template literal types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/#template-literal-types)
or [recursive conditional types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/#recursive-conditional-types),
I'm pretty sure I will be using [pedantic index signature checks](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-beta/#no-unchecked-indexed-access)
whenever I can.
