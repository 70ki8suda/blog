Welcome to Part 2 of "Things I have to say about react-query". As I've become more and more involved with the library and the community around it, I've observed some more patterns people frequently ask about. Here is my take on them.

<b>Disclaimer:</b> If you've never worked with react-query, it doesn't make much sense to continue
reading here. I'm not explaining any basic terms, so it might come across as confusing. If you want
an introduction to the react-query basics, please read the [official docs](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview)
first, especially the Guides & Concepts section. Come back after that and [#1: Practical React Query](practical-react-query)
before continuing here :)

### Data Transformation

Let's face it - most of us are _not_ using GraphQL. If you do, then you can most likely skip this section entirely, because you have the luxury of requesting your data in the format that you desire.

If you are working with REST though, you are constrained by what the backend returns. So how and where do you best transform data when working with react-query? The only answer worth a damn in software development applies here as well:

> It depends.

<p style="padding-left: 3rem; margin-top: -1rem">‚Äî Every developer, always</p>

Here are 3+1 approaches on where you _can_ transform data with their respective pros and cons.

#### 0. On the backend

This is my favourite approach, if you can afford it. If the backend returns data in exactly the structure we want, there is nothing we need to do. While this might sound unrealistic in many cases, e.g. when working with public REST APIs, it is also quite possible to achieve in enterprise applications. If you are in control of the backend and have an endpoint that returns data for your exact use-case, prefer to deliver the data the way you expect it.

-   üü¢ no work on the frontend
-   üî¥ not always possible

#### 1. In the queryFn

The _queryFn_ is the function that you pass to _useQuery_. It expects you to return a Promise, and the resulting data winds up in the query cache. But it doesn't mean that you have to absolutely return data in the structure that the backend delivers here. You can transform it before doing so:

```ts:title=queryFn-transformation
const fetchTodos = async (): Promise<Todos> => {
    const response = await axios.get('todos')
    const data: Todos = response.data

    return data.map((todo) => todo.name.toUpperCase())
}

export const useTodosQuery = () => useQuery(['todos'], () => fetchTodos())
```

On the frontend, you can then work with this data "as if it came like this from the backend". No where in your code will you actually work with todo names that are _not_ upper-cased. You will also _not_ have access to the original structure. If you look at the react-query-devtools, you will see the transformed structure. If you look at the network trace, you'll see the original structure. This might be confusing, so keep that in mind.

Also, there is no optimization that react-query can do for you here. Every time a fetch is executed, your transformation will run. If it's expensive, consider one of the other alternatives. Some companies also have a shared api layer that abstracts data fetching, so you might not have access to this layer to do your transformations.

-   üü¢ very "close to the backend" in terms of co-location
-   üü° the transformed structure winds up in the cache, so you don't have access to the original structure
-   üî¥ runs on every fetch
-   üî¥ not feasible if you have a shared api layer that you cannot freely modify

#### 2. In the render function

#### 3. using the select option

### Render optimizations

### Global error handling

### Type Inference
