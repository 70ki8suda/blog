When GraphQL and especially [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
became popular in ca. 2018, there was a lot of fuss about it completely replacing redux, and the question
[Is Redux dead yet?](https://dev.to/markerikson/redux---not-dead-yet-1d9k) has been asked a lot.

I distinctly remember not understand what this was all about.
Why would some data fetching library replace your global state manager? What does one even have todo with the other?

I was under the impression that GraphQl clients like Apollo would only fetch the data for you,
like for example [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) does for REST,
and that you would still obviously need some way of making that data accessible to your appliation.

I couldn't have been more wrong.
