-   <b>#3: Things to know about useState</b>

[useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) is pretty straight forward to use. A value, a setter function, an initial state. What hidden gems could possibly be there to know about? Well, here are 5 things you can profit from on a daily basis that you might not have known about:

### 1: The functional updater

### 2: The lazy initializer

When we pass an initial value to _useState_, the initial variable is always created, but React will only use it for the first render. This is totally irrelevant for most use cases, e.g. when you pass a string as initial value. In rare cases, we have to do a complex calculation to initialize our state. In these cases, we can pass a function as initial value to _useState_. React will only invoke this function when it really needs the result (= when the component mounts):

```js:title=lazy-initializer
// üö® will unnecessarily be computed on every render
const [value, setValue] = React.useState(calculateExpensiveInitialValue(props))

// ‚úÖ looks like a small difference, but the function is only called once
const [value, setValue] = React.useState(() => calculateExpensiveInitialValue(props))
```

### 3: The update bailout

When you call the updater function, React will not always re-render your component. It will bail out of rendering if you try to update to the same value that your state is currently holding. React uses [Object.is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is#description) to determine if the values are different. See for yourself in this live example:

```js react-live
function App() {
    const [name, setName] = React.useState('Dominik')

    // ü§Ø clicking this button will not re-render the component
    return (
        <button onClick={() => setName('Dominik')}>
            Name is: {name}, Date is: {new Date().getTime()}
        </button>
    )
}

render(<App />)
```

### 4: The convenience overload

This one is for all TypeScript users out there. Type inference for _useState_ usually works great, but if you want to initialize your value with _undefined_ or _null_, you usually need to explicitly specify the generic parameter, because otherwise, TypeScript will not have enough information:

```ts:title=use-state-type-inferrence
// üö® age will be inferred to `undefined` which is kinda useless
const [age, setAge] = React.useState(undefined)

// üÜó but a bit lengthy
const [age, setAge] = React.useState<number | null>(null)
```

Luckily, there is a [convenience overload](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/7a0d9c019f2b48b36b88691247870e6885b97a02/types/react/v16/index.d.ts#L921-L928) of _useState_ that will add _undefined_ to our passed type if we completely omit the initial value. It will also be _undefined_ at runtime, because not passing a parameter at all is equivalent to passing _undefined_ explicitly:

```ts:title=use-state-convenience-overload
// ‚úÖ age will be `number | undefined`
const [age, setAge] = React.useState<number>()
```

Of course, if you absolutely have to initialize with _null_, you need the lengthy version.

### 5: The implementation detail

_useState_ is (kinda) implemented with _useReducer_ under the hood. You can see this in [the source code here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1a7472624661270008011fd77f097d71e6249de9/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.new.js#L1242-L1246). There is also a great article by Kent C. Dodds on [how to implement useState with useReducer](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-implement-usestate-with-usereducer).

### Conclusion

The first 3 of those 5 things are actually mentioned directly in the Hooks API Reference of the official React docs I linked to at the very beginning üòâ. Kent C. Dodds has also written about [2 of them](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/use-state-lazy-initialization-and-function-updates). But if you didn't know about these things before - now you do!
