Out of those two and a half things, I genuinely believe that naming is the hardest.
Why? Because it's not only hard to do, it's also highly subjective.
A good name for you might not be a good name for anyone else.
It is also mostly pointless to argue about it, as you can quickly drift off into bikeshedding.
Good names are also hard (impossible?) to statically analyze, so the bigger the team gets,
the tougher it will be to keep naming consistent.

So what can we do?
I think every team has to come up with a naming scheme that they feel comfortable with,
and then enforce it as good as possible, if striving for a coherent code base is desirable.

I can only give you the rules that I personally like a lot.
They might not work for you. They also might ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Some of them are more subjective, while others are "objectively correct".

### No abbreviations

### Name things for what they _represent_, not for what they _are_

### Inline
