Out of those two and a half things, I genuinely believe that naming is the hardest.
Why? Because it's not only hard to do, it's also highly subjective.
A good name for you might not be a good name for anyone else.
It is also mostly pointless to argue about it, as you can quickly drift off into bikeshedding.
Good names are also hard (impossible?) to statically analyze, so the bigger the team gets,
the tougher it will be to keep naming consistent.

### Why is it important?

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
> Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

Names are a vital part of your programs documentation.
You assign a name to constants, functions or parameters
so that everyone who reads the code knows what those things are meant to be.

The computer actually couldn't care less.
In fact, in frontend programming, lots of code is minified before it is shipped to the browser.
Bundle size and stuff.

Computers don't need to understand the code, they just need to interpret it.
We humans however need to fix the bugs, or add new features.
So understanding what is actually going on is vital to our daily life.

So what can we do?
I think every team has to come up with a naming scheme that they feel comfortable with,
and then enforce it as good as possible, if striving for a coherent code base is desirable
(which I think it is).

I can only give you the rules that I personally like a lot.
They might not work for you. They also might ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Some of them are very subjective, while others seem more "objectively correct".

### No abbreviations

I dislike (almost all) abbreviations, even the common ones.
Try using _PR_ with a non-developer, they will most likely think it means _public relations_.
Twitter made abbreviations more popular because you need to constrain yourselves to a certain length,
and I find this very hard to read. Sometimes, people have typos in their abbreviations,
which makes it impossible to know what they're talking about.

I have a postulation:

> For every abbreviation used, there is at least one person on the team that doesn't know it.

I recently learned what _OTOH_ means. You don't know what people don't know :)

So try to avoid abbreviations whenever possible.
It is fine if the scope is small:

```ts:title=small-scope-abbreviation
posts.map((p) => p.id)
```

Personally, I don't even do that, because there is no harm in writing _post_ instead of _p_.
But I wouldn't insist on a rename here.

I also try to avoid abbreviations whenever possible because there will be situations when you _have to_ use them anyways.
Most companies have business relevant abbreviations that they insist on being used.
You might also need to use external libraries which force a certain name on you.
Even React has `props`, which is technically speaking an abbreviation.

[eslint-plugin-unicorn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/master/docs/rules/prevent-abbreviations.md)
has a rule that tries to tackle this, but I've always needed an extensive whitelist.
I think it's just easier to go with conventions and "common sense" here.

### Inline

Inlining functions, as in, moving them to the place where they are used, has a couple of advantages.
First, you don't need to come up with a name at all, which is great, as naming is hard :)

Second, in most of the situations where I would like to inline functions,
giving them a name is more chore than joy and doesn't really improve readability.

Lastly, if you are using _TypeScript_, types will nicely be inferred for you.
Let's take the above map example:

```ts:title=extracted-mapping function
type Post = { id: string; title: string }

const getPostId = (post: Post) => post.id

// extracted
posts.map(getPostId)

// inlined
posts.map((post) => post.id)
```

I would recommend inlining functions if:

-   they are not used often
-   they are rather small

This comes up a lot with event handlers in React.
And no, inline functions are _not_ bad for performance.

```jsx:title=inlined-event-handler
<button onClick={() => login(username, password)}>Login</button>
```

This example brings me to the next topic:

### Name things for what they _represent_, not for what they _are_
