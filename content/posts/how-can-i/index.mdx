I love answering questions. Most of the time at least üòÖ. It's quite fun, rewarding and educational. People are very grateful when you help them figure out a problem - you get instant feedback and it's mostly a positive experience.

It's also one of the best ways I know to dig deeper into a problem space. You'll have to ask yourself how you would solve a specific situation, even if you haven't experienced it yet. Maybe you have to dig into some code, get familiar with things you've avoided so far because you haven't needed it. Over time, you've _seen a lot_ and inevitably become an expert.

Since I started to become involved in a popular open source library that shall remain unnamed (you know which one), the time I'm spending answering questions has skyrocketed. Now, while I still learn something new almost every day, many questions are technically not very challenging. The hardest part is understanding what the question is about in the first place.

And that can be quite frustrating.

It all depends on the quality of the question. I can usually spot pretty quickly how much time someone has put into asking it. Unfortunately, many questions fall into the category of an [XY Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem).

### XY Problems

We can find a good definition of xy problems at [xyproblem.info](https://xyproblem.info/):

-   User wants to do X.
-   User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.
-   User doesn't know how to do Y either.
-   User asks for help with Y.
-   Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.
-   After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.

I think this happens a lot in software engineering, because developers like to first solve problems on their own and often have done an attempt that _almost works_. They feel that if they can just get this little thing working, it will all be fine. So they ask about this little detail, without presenting the broader picture. They might be on the completely wrong track though, so even if their question is answered, it might not work.

#### Examples

Your internet is not working (a classic), so you tinker a bit with some of the settings. You then proceed to call support with one specific question:

> How can I configure DHCP on my router?

This is your _Y_ question, because you _think_ that's the solution to your real problem (Internet is not working, your _X_). But you haven't asked for that, and there's no guarantee that this will fix your internet. It might be as easy as turning it off and on again instead ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Another real-life (react-query related) example that happened to me more than once is this question:

> How can I pass parameters to refetch?

I could just answer with: _You can't_, because that's technically true, but it won't be a satisfying answer. There are of course solutions to the underlying problem, but without knowing what that is, it's hard to answer.



So if you ever see me respond like this, you know you've just asked an XY question üòâ
