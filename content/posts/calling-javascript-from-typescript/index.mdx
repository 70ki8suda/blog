There is nothing better than starting a new project, on a green field.
You can choose all the latest tech you want, and you can start with great types right from the start.

Obviously, you then wake up from your dream and realise you have to maintain a project with 150k lines of legacy JavaScript code.
If you are lucky, the team started to gradually migrate the codebase to TypeScript.

But it will take some time to "get there".
Until then, you will need some interoperability between JavaScript and TypeScript.
