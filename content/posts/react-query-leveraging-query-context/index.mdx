We all strive to improve as engineers, and as time goes by, we hopefully succeed in that endeavour. Maybe we learn new things that invalidate or challenge our previous thinking. Or we realise that patterns that we thought ideal would not scale to the level we now need them to.

Quite some time has passed since I first started to use React Query. I think I learned a great deal on that journey, and I've also "seen" a lot. I want my blog to be as up-to-date as possible, so that you can come back here and re-read it, knowing that the concepts are still valid. This is now more relevant than ever since [Tanner Linsley](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley) agreed to link to my blog from the official [React Query documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/community/tkdodos-blog).

That's why I've decided to write this addendum to my [Effective React Query Keys](effective-react-query-keys) article. Pleas make sure to read it first to have an understanding of what we are talking about.

### Hot take

<Highlight>
  Don't use inline functions - leverage the Query Context given to you, and
  use a Query Key factory that produces object keys
