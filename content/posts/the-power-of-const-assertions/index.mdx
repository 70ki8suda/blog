[const assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions)
were introduced in TypeScript 3.4, so they are not exactly new (March 2019),
yet I have seen that many developers are still unaware of that feature.

Maybe it's the syntax that makes it a bit weird sometimes (writing `const something = ... as const`),
or maybe it's the resemblance to type casts that make people afraid of using them.
Or maybe you just got some weird errors regarding _readonly_, so you decided to not dig deeper.

In this Article, I'd like clear up the confusion and crush all doubts about const assertions.
