No one likes working with legacy software.
They are hard to maintain.
They are not fun to work with.
Every bug report you get, you feel like: "Oh god please no"!
You don't want to touch _anything_ there.
Adding features? Haven't dared to do that for a long time, because you don't know what will break if you do.

> Never touch a running system

> If it ain't broke, don't fix it

Famous quotes every developer knows, because legacy software is _everywhere_.

### What is legacy software?

We rarely get the chance to bootstrap something from scratch.
Something brand new. A green field.
A place where we will never make the mistakes of the past again.

Except that we will.

Every software project started out on a green field once, where the architects had the best of intentions.
Since no one likes legacy systems, no one creates them on purpose.

They usually derive from incidental complexity, time constraints and shortcuts that we take because we have to.
We are not proud of that code, but it fixes the bug, so let's ship it.
Yes, the customer really wanted that feature, and it needed to be done yesterday (my favourite deadline),
so let's please just make it "quick and dirty" and "refactor it later".

Of course, later is just an anagram for never.

We add a `todo` in the code, or we create a follow-up issue in our favourite backlog,
which already has 500+ issues no one ever looks at.

The second part which contributes to most legacy systems is _feature creep_.
Over time, we add more and more features no one could possibly forsee at the beginning.
With every feature added, it gets harder and harder to maintain the code base,
until at one point you add feature X and break something completely unrelated.

It doesn't necessarily take years for a product to become legacy software (by the above standards).
It's totally possible for a startup to manage that in a couple of months.

### What can we developers do against it?

I concur that some decisions are just out of our hands.
The sales department has already sold the feature to the customer, and it has to be finished by the end of the month.
Bummer.
If situations like these are the norm rather than the exception, it shows categorical mismanagement.
Some companies just don't care, some managers just don't see the benefit of investing in quality now and rather pay the price later.

Personally, I constantly try to talk people out of features.
To me, it is not the duty of developers to "produce features" or even "write code".
Our job is to produce quality.
If that means deleting code, all the better - fewer lines of code to maintain are always a win.
There are enough other involved parties eager to get developers to add features, so I am more reluctant about it.

When it comes to what we _can do_ to avoid legacy software, there is obviously no easy answer.
It's a complex topic that you cannot solve with one simple trick.
There is however one thing that I always put emphasis on when it comes to this topic:
