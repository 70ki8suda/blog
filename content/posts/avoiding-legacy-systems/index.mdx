No one likes working with legacy software.
They are hard to maintain.
They are not fun to work with.
Every bug report you get, you feel like: "Oh god please no"!
You don't want to touch _anything_ there.
Adding features? Haven't dared to do that for a long time, because you don't know what will break if you do.

> Never touch a running system

> If it ain't broke, don't fix it

Famous quotes every developer knows, because legacy software is _everywhere_.

### What is legacy software?

We rarely get the chance to bootstrap something from scratch.
Something brand new. A green field.
A place where we will never make the mistakes of the past again.

Except that we will.

Every software project started out on a green field once, where the architects had the best of intentions.
Since no one likes legacy systems, no one creates them on purpose.

They usually derive from incidental complexity, time constraints and shortcuts that we take because we have to.
We are not proud of that code, but it fixes the bug, so let's ship it.
Yes, the customer really wanted that feature, and it needed to be done yesterday (my favourite deadline),
so let's please just make it "quick and dirty" and "refactor it later".

Of course, later is just an anagram for never.

We add a `todo` in the code, or we create a follow-up issue in our favourite backlog,
which already has 500+ issues no one ever looks at.
