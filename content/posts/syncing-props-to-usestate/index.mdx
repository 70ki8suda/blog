In the [first part](dont-over-use-state) of the useState pitfalls series,
I talked about avoiding state all together for derived state.

This part is about a common scenario, where we want to initialize our state with values we get as props.
This is something we probably do a lot, and it's not per-se wrong, but it has some potential issues that we need to be aware of.

### The example

I will use a classic list / detail use-case as example.
We have a list of users, and selecting one of them will result in a detail form being filled.
We want to show the users' email address in the detail form, and also have an apply button that will update that data.

It's an interactive example, so feel free to click around (the code is also editable):

```js react-live
const users = [
    {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Dominik',
        email: 'dominik@dorfmeister.cc',
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        name: 'John',
        email: 'john@doe.com',
    },
]

function App() {
    const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(users[0])

    return (
        <div>
            {users.map((user) => (
                <button type="button" key={user.id} onClick={() => setSelected(user)}>
                    {user.id === selected.id ? user.name.toUpperCase() : user.name}
                </button>
            ))}
            <DetailView user={selected} />
        </div>
    )
}

function DetailView({ user }) {
    const [email, setEmail] = React.useState(user.email)

    return (
        <div>
            <input
                type="text"
                value={email}
                onChange={(event) => setEmail(event.target.value)}
            />
            <button type="button" onClick={() => alert(email)}>
                Apply
            </button>
        </div>
    )
}

render(<App />)
```
