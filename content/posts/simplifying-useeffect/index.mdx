[useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect). The hook everybody needs, but nobody wants. According to the official react docs, it's an "escape hatch from React’s purely functional world into the imperative world." The [complete guide to useEffect](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/) by Redux author and React core team member [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) is a 49 minute read - and it takes at least twice the time to _really_ comprehend it.

useEffect is about as complicated as it can get in ReactJs, and it is very unlikely that you can write an application without it. So let's try and apply some good principles to working with useEffect:

### Write fewer effects

### Give them names

### Singe Responsibility

### Dependencies
