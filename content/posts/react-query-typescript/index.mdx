[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is üî• - this seems to be a common understanding now in the Frontend community. Many developers expect libraries to either be written in TypeScript, or at least provide good type definitions. For me, if a library is written in TypeScript, the type definitions are the best documentation there is. It's never wrong because it directly reflects the implementation. I frequently look at type definitions before I read API docs.

React Query was initially written in JavaScript (v1), and was then re-written to TypeScript with v2. This means that right now, there is very good support for TypeScript consumers.

There are however a couple of "gotchas" when working with TypeScript due to how dynamic and unopinionated React Query is. Let's go through them one by one to make your experience with it even better.
