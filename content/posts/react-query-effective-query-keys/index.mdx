[Query Keys](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/query-keys) are a very important core concept in React Query. They are necessary so that the library can internally cache your data correctly and refetch automatically when a dependency to your query changes. Lastly, it will allow you to interact with the Query Cache manually when needed, for example when updating data after a mutation or when you need to manually invalidate some queries.

Let's quickly have a look what these three points mean before I'll show you how I personally organize Query Keys to be able to do these things most effectively.

### Caching Data

### Automatic Refetching

### Manual Interaction
