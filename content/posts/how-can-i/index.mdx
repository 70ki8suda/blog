I love answering questions. Most of the time at least üòÖ. It's quite fun, rewarding and educational. People are very grateful when you help them figure out a problem - you get instant feedback and it's mostly a positive experience.

It's also one of the best ways I know to dig deeper into a problem space. You'll have to ask yourself how you would solve a specific situation, even if you haven't experienced it yet. Maybe you have to dig into some code, get familiar with things you've avoided so far because you haven't needed it. Over time, you've _seen a lot_ and inevitably become an expert.

Since I started to become involved in a popular open source library that shall remain unnamed (you know which one), the time I'm spending answering questions has skyrocketed. Now, while I still learn something new almost every day, many questions are technically not very challenging. The hardest part is understanding what the question is about in the first place.

And that can be quite frustrating.
