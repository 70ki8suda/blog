Questions around the testing topic come up quite often together with React Query, so I'll try to answer some of them here. I think one reason for that is that testing "smart" components (also called [container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)) is not the easiest thing to do. With the rise of hooks, this split has been largely deprecated. So we now have much more components that consume dependencies outside of "just props".

They might useContext. They might useSelector. Or they might useQuery.

Those components are technically speaking no longer pure, because calling them in different environments leads to different results. When testing them, you need to carefully setup those surrounding environments to get things working.

### Mocking network requests

Since React Query is an async server state management library, your components will likely make requests to a backend. Of course, when testing, this backend is not available to actually deliver data.

There are tons of articles out there on how to mock data with jest. You can mock your api client if you have one. You can mock fetch or axios directly. I can only second what Kent C. Dodds has written in his article [Stop mocking fetch](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch):

Use [mock service worker](https://mswjs.io/) by [@ApiMocking](https://twitter.com/ApiMocking)

It can be your single source of truth when it comes mocking your apis:

-   works in node for testing
-   supports REST and GraphQL
-   has a [storybook addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/msw-storybook-addon) so you can write stories for your components that _useQuery_
-   works in the browser for development purposes, and you'll still see the requests going out in the browser devtools
-   works with cypress, similar to fixtures

With our network layer being out of the way, we can start talking about React Query specific things to keep an eye on:
