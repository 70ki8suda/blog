Questions around the testing topic come up quite often together with React Query, so I'll try to answer some of them here. I think one reason for that is that testing "smart" components (also called [container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)) is not the easiest thing to do. With the rise of hooks, this split has been largely deprecated. So we now have much more components that consume dependencies outside of "just props".

They might useContext. They might useSelector. Or they might useQuery.

Those components are technically speaking no longer pure, because calling them in different environments leads to different results. When testing them, you need to carefully setup those surrounding environments to get things working.

### Mocking network requests

Since React Query is an async server state management library, your components will likely make requests to a backend. Of course, when testing, this backend is not available to actually deliver data.

There are tons of articles out there on how to mock data with jest. You can mock your api client if you have one. You can mock fetch or axios directly. I can only second what Kent C. Dodds has written in his article [Stop mocking fetch](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch):

Use [mock service worker](https://mswjs.io/) by [@ApiMocking](https://twitter.com/ApiMocking)

It can be your single source of truth when it comes mocking your apis:

-   works in node for testing
-   supports REST and GraphQL
-   has a [storybook addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/msw-storybook-addon) so you can write stories for your components that _useQuery_
-   works in the browser for development purposes, and you'll still see the requests going out in the browser devtools
-   works with cypress, similar to fixtures

With our network layer being taken care of, we can start talking about React Query specific things to keep an eye on:

### QueryClientProvider

Whenever you use React Query, you need a QueryClientProvider and give it a queryClient - a vessel which holds the _QueryCache_. The cache will in turn hold the data of your queries. Some tutorials suggest creating one QueryClient and resetting it after each test, but I think that shared state during tests is not a good idea at all. What if tests run in parallel? You might get unexpected results and flaky tests with this approach.

I do prefer to give each test it's own QueryClientProvider, and create a _new QueryCache_ for each test. That way, tests are completely isolated from each other.

#### For custom hooks

If you are testing custom hooks, I'm quite certain you're using [react-hooks-testing-library](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/). It's the easiest thing there is to test hooks. With that library, we can wrap our hook in a [wrapper](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/reference/api#wrapper), which is a React component to wrap the test component in when rendering. I think this is the perfect place to create the QueryClient, because it will be executed once per test:

```tsx:title=wrapper
const createWrapper = () => {
    const queryClient = new QueryClient()
    return ({ children }) => (
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
    )
}

test("my first test", async () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useCustomHook(), {
    wrapper: createWrapper()
  })
}
```

#### For components

If you want to test a Component that uses a _useQuery_ hook, you also need to wrap that Component in QueryClientProvider. A shallow wrapper around _render_ from [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) seems like a good choice. Have a look at how React Query does it [internally for their tests](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query/blob/ead2e5dd5237f3d004b66316b5f36af718286d2d/src/react/tests/utils.tsx#L6-L17)
